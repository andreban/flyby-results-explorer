# Progress

## What Works

- The application successfully renders a list of round-trip flight results using mock data.
- The filtering functionality is working for price range, airports, stops, and airlines.
- The sorting functionality is working for price, duration, departure, and arrival times.
- The UI is responsive and provides a good user experience on different screen sizes.
- The "Book" button simulation with a toast notification is implemented.
- The application correctly displays the search query information.
- The price filter now correctly uses a dual-handle slider and displays the selected range with labels.

## What's Left to Build

- **Smart Filters UI:** Implement the user interface for the new Smart Filters feature.
- **UI/UX Refinements:** Continue to improve the visual design and user experience of the flight results page.
- **Component Refactoring:** Refactor components for better reusability and maintainability.
- **Testing:** Implement unit and component tests to ensure the application is working as expected.

## Known Issues

- The application relies entirely on mock data. While this is acceptable for a demo, it's important to ensure the data structures are realistic and well-documented.
- The filtering and sorting logic is performed on the client-side. For this demo, this is acceptable.
