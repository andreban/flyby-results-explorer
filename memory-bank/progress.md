# Progress

## What Works

- The application successfully renders a list of round-trip flight results using mock data.
- The filtering functionality is working for price range, airports, stops, and airlines.
- The sorting functionality is working for price, duration, departure, and arrival times.
- The UI is responsive and provides a good user experience on different screen sizes.
- The "Book" button simulation with a toast notification is implemented.
- The application correctly displays the search query information.
- The price filter now correctly uses a dual-handle slider and displays the selected range with labels. A bug that caused the `minPrice` to reset has been fixed. The `minPrice` label now correctly displays the absolute minimum price, and the slider correctly resets when a price filter is not active.
- **Smart Filters:** The Smart Filters feature is now connected to the Built-in AI API and can extract filter criteria from natural language queries. The integration has been improved to use a system prompt and to control the model's output with `temperature` and `topK` parameters. The logic for handling `nonstop`, `onestop`, and `twostop` filters has been corrected to align with the application's filter state. A regression that prevented the price filter from being updated by the Smart Filters feature has been fixed.
- **Deployment:** The application now uses `HashRouter` and relative paths in `index.html` to support deployments to relative paths and prevent 404 errors. The `NotFound` page has been updated to use the `Link` component for correct client-side navigation.
- **Airport Filter Compatibility:** Standardized the application to use 3-letter IATA codes for airport filtering, ensuring compatibility between the Prompt API and manual filter controls. The filtering logic has been updated for improved reliability.
- **Display Airport Names:** The UI now displays airport names alongside their IATA codes in the flight results and filters, improving clarity for the user.

## What's Left to Build

- **Smart Filters UI:** Implement the user interface for the new Smart Filters feature.
- **UI/UX Refinements:** Continue to improve the visual design and user experience of the flight results page.
- **Component Refactoring:** Refactor components for better reusability and maintainability.
- **Testing:** Implement unit and component tests to ensure the application is working as expected.

## Known Issues

- The application relies entirely on mock data. While this is acceptable for a demo, it's important to ensure the data structures are realistic and well-documented.
- The filtering and sorting logic is performed on the client-side. For this demo, this is acceptable.
