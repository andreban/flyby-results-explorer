## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on refining the user interface for the new **Smart Filters** feature.

## Recent Changes

- **Smart Filters UI:**
    - Created the initial UI for the Smart Filters feature.
    - Removed the "BETA" and "Powered by ChatGPT" text from the UI, as requested.
    - Adjusted the styling and layout of the Smart Filters component to better align with the rest of the filter area.
- **Price Filter Refinement:**
    - Reverted the price filter to its original design with labels, as requested, while keeping the dual-handle slider functionality.
    - Fixed an issue where the `Slider` component was only rendering one handle.
- **TypeScript and ESLint Fixes:**
    - Resolved a series of TypeScript errors related to module resolution by updating the `tsconfig.app.json` file and ensuring `React` was explicitly imported.
    - Fixed an ESLint error related to the use of the `any` type in a function signature.

## Next Steps

- **UI/UX Refinements:** Continue to refine the UI and UX of the Smart Filters feature and the rest of the application.
- **Code Quality:** Review the codebase for any potential improvements in terms of readability, maintainability, and performance.
- **Testing:** Begin to add unit and component tests to ensure the application is robust and reliable.
