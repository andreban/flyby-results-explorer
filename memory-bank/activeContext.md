# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on refining the existing "Flyby Results Explorer" demo page to ensure it meets all the specified requirements. This includes:
- Verifying that all required information is displayed correctly for the search query and flight results.
- Ensuring all filtering and sorting options are implemented and working correctly.
- Polishing the UI and ensuring a high-quality, responsive user experience.

## Recent Changes

- **Price Filter Refinement:**
    - Initially updated the price filter to include `Input` fields for more precise control.
    - Reverted the price filter to its original design with labels, as requested, while keeping the dual-handle slider functionality.
    - Fixed an issue where the `Slider` component was only rendering one handle.
- **TypeScript and ESLint Fixes:**
    - Resolved a series of TypeScript errors related to module resolution by updating the `tsconfig.app.json` file and ensuring `React` was explicitly imported.
    - Fixed an ESLint error related to the use of the `any` type in a function signature.
- **Memory Bank Update:** Updated the Memory Bank to reflect the clarified scope of the project as a single-page demo application.

## Next Steps

- **UI/UX Refinements:** The immediate next step is to perform a detailed review of the UI and UX, and identify areas for improvement. This could include:
    - Improving the layout and spacing of components.
    - Enhancing the visual design and branding.
    - Ensuring the application is fully accessible.
- **Code Quality:** Review the codebase for any potential improvements in terms of readability, maintainability, and performance.
- **Testing:** Begin to add unit and component tests to ensure the application is robust and reliable.
