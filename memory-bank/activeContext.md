# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on ensuring the new **Smart Filters** feature is working correctly and is well-integrated with the existing filter system.

## Recent Changes

- **Price Range Slider Fix:**
    - Fixed an issue where the price range slider was not being updated when the filters were changed by the Smart Filters feature.
    - Lifted the `tempPriceRange` state up to the `Index` page to allow it to be controlled by both the `FilterSidebar` and `SmartFilters` components.
- **Smart Filters Logic:**
    - Created a new `getFilterConfigFromQuery` function that returns a mock filter configuration.
    - Integrated this function into the `SmartFilters` component.
- **TypeScript and ESLint Fixes:**
    - Resolved a series of TypeScript errors and ESLint warnings that arose during the implementation of the new features.

## Next Steps

- **API Integration:** Replace the mock implementation of `getFilterConfigFromQuery` with a real API call to a natural language processing service.
- **UI/UX Refinements:** Continue to refine the UI and UX of the Smart Filters feature and the rest of the application.
- **Testing:** Add tests for the new Smart Filters functionality.
