# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on ensuring the application is free of bugs and that all features are working as expected.

## Recent Changes

- **Prompt API Integration:**
    - The integration with the Prompt API has been updated to use a system prompt and to set the `temperature` and `topK` parameters.
    - The JSON schema has been updated to include default values and to disallow additional properties.
- **API Integration:** Replaced the mock implementation of `getFilterConfigFromQuery` with a real API call to the Built-in AI (Gemini Nano) service.
- **"Clear All Filters" Bug Fix:**
    - Fixed a bug where the "Clear all filters" button in the empty results view was not resetting the price range slider.
- **Price Range Slider Fix:**
    - Fixed an issue where the price range slider was not being updated when the filters were changed by the Smart Filters feature.
- **Smart Filters Logic:**
    - Created a new `getFilterConfigFromQuery` function that returns a mock filter configuration.
- **TypeScript and ESLint Fixes:**
    - Resolved a series of TypeScript errors and ESLint warnings.
- **Stops Filter Logic:**
    - Updated the `getFilterConfigFromQuery` function to correctly handle the `nonstop`, `onestop`, and `twostop` settings from the AI model and transform them into the `stops` array required by the application's filter state.
    - Corrected the JSON schema in `ai.ts` to use `onestop` and `twostop` to match the expected property names.
- **Price Filter Bug Fix:**
    - Fixed a bug where the `minPrice` filter would reset to its default value after being adjusted. This was resolved by separating the filter change handlers for manual and smart filter updates.
- **Smart Filter Price Update Bug Fix:**
    - Fixed a regression where the `minPrice` and `maxPrice` filters were not being updated when the Prompt API returned new values.

## Next Steps

- **UI/UX Refinements:** Continue to refine the UI and UX of the Smart Filters feature and the rest of the application.
- **Testing:** Add tests for the new Smart Filters functionality and the "Clear all filters" button.
