# Product Context

## Problem Space

This project serves as a **demo application** to showcase a well-designed and functional flight results page. The primary challenge is to present a realistic and interactive flight search experience on a single page, without the need for a full backend or multi-page application. It aims to demonstrate strong frontend skills in building complex, data-driven interfaces.

## User Experience Goals

- **Clarity and Simplicity:** The interface should be clean and easy to understand, allowing users to quickly grasp the available flight options.
- **Efficient Filtering:** Users should be able to easily and effectively filter the flight results to narrow down the options to their specific requirements.
- **Responsive Design:** The application should be fully responsive and provide a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Informative Feedback:** The system should provide clear feedback to the user, such as the number of results found and notifications for actions like booking.
- **Realistic Simulation:** The demo should feel like a real application, even though it is powered by mock data.
