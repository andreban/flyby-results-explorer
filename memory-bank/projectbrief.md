# Project Brief

## Core Requirements and Goals

This project is a demo application showcasing a single "Flyby Results Explorer" page from a travel metasearch website.

### Core Features:
- **Display Search Query:** Show the origin, destination, dates, and number of passengers for the flight search.
- **Display Flight Results:** Show a list of round-trip flight options, including:
    - Airline
    - Origin and destination airports
    - Departure and arrival times
    - Flight duration
    - Price
    - Number of stops
- **Filtering:** Allow users to filter flights by:
    - Price range
    - Departure and arrival airports
    - Number of stops
    - Airlines
- **Sorting:** Allow users to sort the results by price, duration, departure time, and arrival time.
- **Booking Button:** Each result should have a button that simulates taking the user to a booking page.
- **Smart Filters (UI Only):** A natural language interface for filtering flights. The user can type in their desired filters in plain English, and the system will apply them. For now, only the UI for this feature will be implemented.

### Out of Scope:
- Flight search form
- Booking pages
- User authentication
- Any other pages besides the flight results page
- The implementation of the natural language processing for the Smart Filters feature.

### Primary Goals:
- Provide a clean, intuitive, and responsive user interface for exploring flight options within the scope of a demo.
- Implement robust filtering and sorting functionality using mock data.
- Create a well-structured and maintainable codebase using React, TypeScript, and modern development practices.
