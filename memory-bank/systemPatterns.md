# System Patterns

## System Architecture

The project follows a standard **component-based architecture**, which is common for React applications. The UI is broken down into a hierarchy of reusable components.

- **`src/`**: The main application source code.
- **`src/components/`**: Contains reusable UI components.
  - **`src/components/ui/`**: Likely contains base UI components from the shadcn/ui library.
- **`src/pages/`**: Represents the different pages of the application, likely corresponding to different routes.
- **`src/hooks/`**: Custom React hooks for reusable logic.
- **`src/data/`**: For mock or static data.
- **`src/lib/`**: Utility functions and libraries.

## Design Patterns

- **Component-Based Architecture:** The UI is built as a tree of components, promoting reusability and separation of concerns.
- **Hooks:** React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, custom hooks) are used for managing state and side effects within functional components.
- **Utility-First CSS (Tailwind CSS):** Styles are applied directly in the markup using utility classes, which allows for rapid UI development without writing custom CSS.

## Component Relationships

- **`main.tsx`**: The entry point of the application, responsible for rendering the root `App` component.
- **`App.tsx`**: The root component, which likely sets up the main layout and routing.
- **Pages (`src/pages/`)**: High-level components that are rendered based on the current route. They compose smaller, reusable components from `src/components/`.
- **UI Components (`src/components/ui/`)**: Low-level, presentational components that are used to build more complex UI elements.
